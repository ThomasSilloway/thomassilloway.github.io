MC page ideas

- Github pages
- Typeform embed button already done

Color #B488DC

Themes
- Gradiant - https://pages-themes.github.io/modernist/
- Maybe with replace green with purple? https://pages-themes.github.io/hacker/
- 2 column layout? https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/

Tried learning how to use react - the test page I made has shitty react code, so would need to learn it from scratch

Probably better off using the tutorials or use that template maker to output the html & I'll add javascript to it - seems like a waste when I could learn React instead.

Learnings
	- Got my logo converted to SVG!
	- Went far down a rabbit hole trying to get the layout for this template site working.  Looks like it's just for layout & not functionality
	- Take a break before going down the rabbit hole
	- Learned some about how React works
	- Deployed some sample websites to Google Pages
	- Got the contact form working in both google forms & another one that's actually pretty good
	- All of this to manually create a website, when Wix or Squarespace would do all this stuff for me, yikes, definitely worth exploring that.
	- Probably will just use the built in Github pages theme stuff, seems like that would save a lot of effort & still be free.
	- Learned how to build & deploy react apps on Google Pages
	
Day 2

Webflow - Contact form - Got it set up with IFTTT
Weird interaction with custom link, can solve with custom javascript, or maybe by exporting the site & replacing the url
